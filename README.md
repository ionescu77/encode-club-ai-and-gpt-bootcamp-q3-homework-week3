## Weekend Project - Week 3 Homework

To consolidate this week's knowledge, students should complete the following project:

1. Create a GitHub repository for your project
2. Add all group members as collaborators
3. Create a README.md file with your project description
4. Use the `story-telling-app` as a base repository or create a new application from scratch using NextJS
5. Implement a table of characters that users can create for the story
   - Users should be able to add, edit, and delete characters
   - Each new character should have a name, description, and personality
6. Customize the prompt to generate a story using user-created characters, if any
7. Implement a summary of each character's role in the story after the full text has been generated
8. Test different models for story generation and compare their outputs
   - Evaluate how well the models "remember" user-created characters
   - Experiment with different **context window** sizes across models to observe their impact on output
   - Test models of varying sizes and observe how this influences the output
     - Use models compatible with your device, focusing on the experiment rather than overall story quality
9. Submit your project via the submission form
